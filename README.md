I obtained my MASc from Concordia Univeristy, Montreal where I worked with Profs. Lingyu Wang and Suryadipta Majumdar. I was involved as a researcher in [NSERC/Ericsson IRC in SDN/NFV Security project](https://arc.encs.concordia.ca/index.html). My research focus is on optimal proactive attack detection and non-disruptive mitigation in cloud environment.
